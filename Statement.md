Here is a clear and simple project statement for a digital clock using Python:

Project Statement:
A digital clock is a Python-based application that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds using a graphical user interface. This project uses the Tkinter library to continuously update the time in real-time by retrieving system time through the time module. The goal is to create a user-friendly clock that refreshes every second and visually represents time in a digital format, demonstrating concepts of GUI programming, event loops, and dynamic updates in Python.

If you want, I can also give a shorter statement, longer description, objective, or complete code.
